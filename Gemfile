# A sample Gemfile
# To get Sinatra working with ActiveRecord, First, we'll add three gems to allow us to use ActiveRecord: activerecord version 5.2, sinatra-activerecord, and rake. The activerecord gem gives us access to the magical database mapping and association powers. The rake gem, short for "ruby make", is a package that lets us quickly create files and folders, and automate tasks such as database creation, and the sinatra-activerecord gem gives us access to some awesome Rake tasks. Make sure those three gems are added in your Gemfile:



source "https://rubygems.org"

  gem 'sinatra'
  gem 'thin'
  gem 'require_all'
  gem 'activerecord', '5.2'
  gem 'sinatra-activerecord'
  gem 'rake'

group :development do
	gem 'shotgun'
	gem 'pry'
	gem 'sqlite3', '~> 1.3.6'
	gem 'tux'
end
